# Project Portfolio

This is my portfolio that I have created during the nology course! This will be continuously updated as I learn new things and create new projects!

## This Project

The purpose of this portfolio is to test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, and Git. It will also be a viewpoint for employers and coworkers to see what I can do.
