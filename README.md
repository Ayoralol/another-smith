## NOTES

- Change colors to text colors + slight gradients on the pages

## Page layout/goals

- Single page, simplistic
- Side bar "scroll" buttons, scrolling moves page down a whole sheet smoothly, or press button for exact effect (https://olaolu.dev/)
- Subtle animations on each page - like astnly's underscore/cursor but different everywhere
- Nav dropdown/sidebar for links, stays on every page, WHOLE PAGE scrolls to the side when this is opened

### Nav/Dropdown thingo

- Darker background on home page
- lighter background on pages 2/3
- When on page 4 moves the entire page off the screen instead of scrolling down

### Main landing

- Make logo for myself
- Junior Full-Stack Developer heading
- Short summary of something like "I like to make things that are functional and make sense" or the like
- Photo of me
- clean colors

### Page 2 - Projects worked on

- List of projects I have created
- descriptions
- live links
- github links
- pictures

### Page 3 - What I am trained in

- HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Javascript, git, Java, ReactJS, AWS, SQL, Springboot?, FireBase & FireStore - Lift logos from astnly.com
- "Also a", Qualified Chef (TAFE NSW), Accountant (ONLINE ACCREDIT) and dad (Me and Link from behind)
- Add specific little easter eggs for each code type - eg..
- Have a `<html>` opening tag that displays a `</html>` tag when hovered.
- have a `css {}` that expands down to `css:hover {color: $secondary-color;}` and changes color
- have a `scss {}` that goes to like `@use "./partials/palette.scss" -> scss:hover {color: $main-text;}`
- have a `function onButtonPress() {showThis.innerHTML = textDisplay;}`

### Page 4 - Get in touch

- expand dropdown/sidebar across whole screen (in a smooth animation if possible)
- add in a description of me or personality/hobbies etc.
- make the links bigger/clearer
- Have footer of what this was written in etc.
